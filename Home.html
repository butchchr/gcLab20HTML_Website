                    <p>Hello, I am Chris Butcher a .NET Developer. When I started this lab assignment I had
                        <br> much higher hopes for this webzone and it turned out to be significantly more difficult
                        <br> than I had anticipated. I drew inspiration for this webzone from growing up in the 90â€™s
                        <br> I need a lot more practice at HTML and CSS before I show this webzone to anyone.

                    <p>When I am not in front of a computer I enjoy traveling, riding bikes, and eating as much
                        <br> local food on which I can get my hands. I try to wrap all of them in together and have
                        <br> planned bike trips to awesome locations that have great local food. If you are looking
                        <br> for an idea I definitely recommend heading to Copper Harbor, MI. They have the best
                        <br> mountain biking in the state and whitefish tacos from Captain Matt are a personal favorite.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately I am a far better backed developer than I am at front end development. I have been
                        <br>interested in the STEM fields since I was a kid. I spent many summers going to week long
                        <br>science day camps. My family got our first computer in 1992 and I can remember the day
                        <br>we got internet access (and all the modem upgrades before getting 56K).
