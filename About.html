                <p>Look at that handsome fella. Wait a minute...thats me! Your eyes do not deceive you. The beignet loving biker
                    <br>in the photo is yours truly. I have spent the last decade working in Higher Education Administration
                    <br>for Grand Valley State University for the Department of Public Safety Services. I started out primarily
                    <br>as a patrol officer and slowly moved to a more administrative role where I spend time training new officers
                    <br>and reviewing policies and paperwork.

                    <br>
                    <br>Years ago I gave up my strong jawline and marathon runner physique when a knee injury turned out to be
                    <br>far more severe than even the orthopedic surgeon had predicted. I traded my running shoes for a far more
                    <br> comfortable pair of cycling shoes and spend just as much time working on bikes as I do riding them. I do some
                    <br>volunteer work with several cycling related non profits in the Grand Rapids area.
