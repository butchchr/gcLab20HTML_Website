                    <br> The guy next to me in the photo is my brother who happens to be a software engineer
                    <br> and all around good guy. He was the one who convinced me to take the intro to computer
                    <br> science classes “just to see if I like it.” Well I did and took a sabbatical so that could
                    <br> join Grand Circus’s .NET bootcamp. I have had a wonderful experience and have worked on a
                    <br> lot of great projects. You should hop on over to my <a href= "https://github.com/butchchr">Git Hub</a> account and check them out.
                    <br>If you like what you see stop by my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/butchchr/">LinkedIn</a> and message me on how we can collaborate.
